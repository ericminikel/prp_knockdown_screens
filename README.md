This repository holds the data and source code for an analysis of three high-throughput screens for compounds to knock down PrP.

For background and narrative, see [this blog post](http://www.cureffi.org/2015/11/18/a-look-at-prp-knockdown-screen-data/) on [CureFFI.org](http://www.cureffi.org/).

To reproduce the analysis, note that you will need [this file](https://github.com/ericminikel/miscellanea/blob/master/r_helper.r), and the `rcdk`, `fingerprint` and `sqldf` libraries for R.
